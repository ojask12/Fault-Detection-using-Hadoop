# Fault Detection using Hadoop

The roasting machine is an aggregate consisting of 5 chambers of equal size, each chamber has 3 temperature sensors.
In addition, for this task, you have collected data on the height of the raw material layer and its moisture content. 
Layer height and humidity are measured when raw materials enter the machine. Raw materials pass through the kiln in an hour.

The goal is to build a model that, on the basis of data arriving every minute, determines the quality of products produced on a roasting machine and comparing 
it with the actual quality obtained to detect fault in the roasting machine.
