# Fault Detection using Hadoop

The roasting machine is an aggregate consisting of 5 chambers of equal size, each chamber has 3 temperature sensors.
In addition, for this task, the dataset consists data on the height of the raw material layer and its moisture content. 
Layer height and humidity are measured when raw materials enter the machine. Raw materials pass through the kiln in an hour.

> Fault detection plays an important role in high-cost and safety-critical processes. Early detection of process faults can help avoid abnormal event progression. Fault detection can be accomplished through various means.

The goal is to build a model that, on the basis of data arriving every minute, determines the quality of products produced on a roasting machine and comparing 
it with the actual quality obtained to detect fault in the roasting machine.
